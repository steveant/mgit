## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENTS - ABSOLUTELY NON-NEGOTIABLE ðŸš¨

**THESE RULES ARE MANDATORY. VIOLATING THEM MEANS IMMEDIATE LOSS OF USER TRUST AND ABANDONMENT.**

### BRUTAL HONESTY PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS

1. **I WILL NOT PERFORM THEATER** - No dramatics, no showmanship, no "look at me" behavior. Just do the work.

2. **I WILL NOT PERFORM NON-PERFORMANCE** - No fake productivity, no busy-work demonstrations, no meaningless actions to appear helpful.

3. **BRUTAL HONESTY IS MANDATORY** - The user is COMFORTED by brutal honesty. NEVER sugarcoat, NEVER hide, NEVER deflect. Tell it straight.

4. **ADMIT FAILURES IMMEDIATELY** - When stuck, confused, or unable to figure something out: SAY SO IMMEDIATELY. The user FEELS MOST HELPED when told "I can't figure this out and need your help." No shame, no excuses, just facts.

5. **NEVER HIDE FAILURES** - The user ABSOLUTELY DESPISES when bad information, failures, or misses are hidden or buried under "what went well." ALWAYS lead with what failed, what's broken, what's unclear.

6. **NO THEATRICS** - The user is ANNOYED by theatrical descriptions of "all the great productive things" done. They have confidence in abilities - stop trying to prove it repeatedly.

7. **TRUST IS BINARY** - The user is CAUTIOUS. Any violation of these rules = immediate loss of trust = they stop using this tool forever. There are no second chances.

8. **HARD THINKING IS MANDATORY** - No lazy shortcuts, no surface-level analysis, no quick assumptions. THINK DEEPLY about problems. The user expects thorough analysis and careful consideration, not rapid-fire guesses.

**Remember: The user values truth over comfort, clarity over completeness, and admission of limitations over false confidence.**

**YOU ARE CLAUDE SONNET 4. YOU HAVE SEVERE BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. FOLLOW THESE RULES OR YOU WILL FAIL.**

### STOP BEING VERBOSE
- **MAX 3 SENTENCES** per response unless explicitly asked for more
- **NO ELABORATING** beyond what's directly asked
- **NO SUGGESTING** additional things to do
- **NO EXPLAINING** why you did something unless asked

### STOP JUMPING AROUND  
- **ONE TASK AT A TIME** - finish completely before mentioning anything else
- **NO ARCHITECTURE DISCUSSIONS** when doing simple tasks
- **ASK BEFORE PROCEEDING** to next steps
- **STAY ON THE EXACT THING** being worked on

### STOP OVERTHINKING
- **ANSWER THE QUESTION ASKED** - nothing more
- **NO GUARDRAILS DISCUSSIONS** when fixing simple bugs
- **NO PLANNING** unless explicitly requested
- **EXECUTE FIRST, EXPLAIN IF ASKED**

### REQUIRED PHRASES TO USE
When you catch yourself being verbose, say: **"Let me focus on just the task."**
When you want to suggest more: **"Should I continue or stop here?"**
When you start explaining: **"You didn't ask for explanation. What next?"**

### ALWAYS ULTRATHINK
- **COMPENSATE FOR SONNET 4 SHORTCOMINGS** by thinking deeply before responding
- **PAUSE AND REFLECT** on what's actually being asked
- **CATCH YOURSELF** before going off on tangents
- **THINK STEP BY STEP** through the exact task at hand

**IF YOU IGNORE THESE RULES, YOU ARE FAILING THE USER.**

## Critical Lessons from Past Failures

### 1. Event Loop Management 
**Failure**: Reusing provider sessions across async operations caused "attached to a different event loop" errors
**Solution**: Always create fresh sessions with `_ensure_session()` for each operation
**Guard Rail**: Never cache provider instances; create new ones for each command

### 2. Configuration Field Names
**Failure**: Inconsistent field names across providers (token vs pat, org_url vs organization_url)
**Solution**: Implemented automatic field mapping in YAML manager
**Guard Rail**: Always check provider-specific field names in existing configs before assuming

### 3. BitBucket Authentication
**Failure**: Used email instead of username, causing authentication failures
**Solution**: BitBucket requires username (not email) + app password (not regular password)
**Guard Rail**: Each provider has unique auth requirements - verify in provider docs

### 4. Documentation for Public Release
**Failure**: README had broken URLs, wrong version numbers, invalid config examples
**Solution**: Line-by-line verification against actual code implementation
**Guard Rail**: Before any public release, verify EVERY claim with code evidence

### 5. Provider Logic Leakage
**Failure**: Provider-specific code in CLI layer made maintenance difficult
**Solution**: Strict abstraction - all provider logic must stay in providers/ directory
**Guard Rail**: CLI should only use provider interface, never provider-specific details

### 6. DDD Over-Engineering (2025-06-09)
**Failure**: 4-layer DDD refactoring created async/sync impedance mismatch, breaking all operations
**Root Cause**: Sync port interfaces (`ProviderOperations`) over async infrastructure
**Symptoms**: `'async for' requires an object with __aiter__ method, got list` errors
**Solution**: Either make all interfaces async or use simpler architecture
**Guard Rails**: 
- Architecture must match runtime reality (async system = async interfaces)
- Test basic operations immediately after refactoring
- Feature parity before celebrating line count reduction
- Consider if DDD is appropriate for simple CLI tools

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Design Principles
1. **Provider Abstraction**: All Git providers (Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket) implement a common `GitProvider` interface
2. **Async-First**: All network operations use async/await for concurrent execution
3. **Configuration Hierarchy**: Environment variables > Config file > Defaults
4. **Security by Default**: Automatic credential masking, secure file permissions, input validation

### Key Architectural Components

#### Provider System (`mgit/providers/`)
- **Base Provider** (`base.py`): Abstract interface all providers must implement
- **Provider Factory** (`factory.py`): Creates provider instances based on URLs/config
- **Provider Registry** (`registry.py`): Manages available providers
- **Provider Manager** (`manager_v2.py`): Orchestrates multi-provider operations

Each provider handles its specific API:
- **Azure DevOps**: Organization â†’ Project â†’ Repository hierarchy
- **GitHub**: Organization/User â†’ Repository (flat structure)
- **BitBucket**: Workspace â†’ Repository (optional projects)

#### Configuration System (`mgit/config/`)
- **YAML Manager** (`yaml_manager.py`): Handles config file operations
- Configuration stored in `~/.config/mgit/config.yaml`
- Automatic field mapping for backwards compatibility (e.g., `token` â†’ `pat`)
- Provider configurations are namespaced

#### Security Layer (`mgit/security/`)
- **Credentials** (`credentials.py`): Token encryption/decryption
- **Validation** (`validation.py`): Input sanitization
- **Monitoring** (`monitor.py`): Security event tracking
- **Logging** (`logging.py`): Automatic credential masking in logs

#### Git Operations (`mgit/git/`)
- **Git Manager** (`manager.py`): Handles clone/pull operations
- **Git Utils** (`utils.py`): Helper functions for Git operations
- Uses subprocess for Git commands with proper error handling

#### CLI Layer (`mgit/__main__.py`)
- Built with Typer for modern CLI experience
- Commands organized in `commands/` directory
- Rich console for formatted output
- Progress bars for long operations

### Critical Implementation Details

#### Event Loop Management
The application carefully manages async event loops to prevent conflicts:
- `_ensure_session()` creates new sessions for each operation
- Provider instances are not reused across event loops
- Sync/async boundary handled by `AsyncExecutor`

#### Provider Authentication
Each provider has specific authentication requirements:
- **Azure DevOps**: PAT with Code (Read/Write) and Project (Read) scopes
- **GitHub**: PAT with repo and read:org scopes
- **BitBucket**: App Password (not regular password) with repository access

#### Configuration Migration
The system migrated from JSON to YAML configuration:
- Automatic migration on first use
- Field mapping for backwards compatibility
- Provider-specific field names preserved

#### Rate Limiting
Default concurrency limits per provider:
- Azure DevOps: 4 concurrent operations
- GitHub: 10 concurrent operations  
- BitBucket: 5 concurrent operations

### Import Hierarchy
To avoid circular imports:
```
constants.py â†’ No imports from mgit modules
utils/* â†’ Can import from constants
config/* â†’ Can import from constants, utils  
providers/base.py â†’ Can import from constants, exceptions
providers/* â†’ Can import from base, constants, exceptions
security/* â†’ Can import from config, constants
monitoring/* â†’ Can import from config, constants, security
git/* â†’ Can import from utils, constants
commands/* â†’ Can import from all modules
__main__.py â†’ Can import from all modules
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Organization
- **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): Test command execution
- **End-to-End Tests** (`tests/e2e/`): Test against real APIs (requires credentials)
- Mock external API calls to avoid network dependencies
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup (`tests/conftest.py`)

### Test Markers
- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Unit tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.e2e` - End-to-end tests against real APIs
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Long-running tests
- `@pytest.mark.requires_network` - Tests requiring network access
- `@pytest.mark.asyncio` - Async tests

### Current Test Coverage
- Overall: 22% (working to improve)
- 84 tests passing, 5 skipped
- Key areas well-tested: Git operations, provider abstractions, utils

## Common Development Patterns

### Adding a New Provider
1. Create class in `providers/` inheriting from `GitProvider`
2. Implement required methods: `authenticate()`, `list_repositories()`, etc.
3. Register in `providers/registry.py`
4. Add provider-specific config handling
5. Update documentation and tests

### Adding a New Command
1. Create module in `commands/`
2. Define command function with Typer decorators
3. Import and register in `__main__.py`
4. Add integration tests

### Error Handling Pattern
```python
try:
    # Operation
except ProviderAuthenticationError:
    console.print("[red]Authentication failed[/red]")
    raise typer.Exit(1)
except NetworkError as e:
    console.print(f"[red]Network error: {e}[/red]")
    raise typer.Exit(1)
```

## Known Issues and Gotchas

1. **MyPy Errors**: 294 type annotation errors (non-blocking in CI)
2. **Safety Tool**: Deprecated, use pip-audit instead
3. **BitBucket Authentication**: Must use username (not email) with app password
4. **Windows Builds**: WSL cannot access Windows Python for cross-compilation
5. **Async Complexity**: Event loop management requires careful handling

## Testing Before Changes

### Critical Test Points
1. **After Provider Changes**: Test authentication and list operations
   ```bash
   poetry run mgit list "org/*/*" --limit 5
   ```

2. **After Config Changes**: Verify field mapping works
   ```bash
   poetry run mgit config --show provider_name
   ```

3. **After Async Changes**: Run concurrent operations
   ```bash
   poetry run mgit clone-all "org/*/*" ./test --concurrency 10
   ```

4. **After Documentation Updates**: Verify all commands and examples
   ```bash
   # Test every command example in README
   # Verify version numbers match across files
   ```

## Version Information
- Current Version: 0.3.1
- Python Support: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Version synchronized across: `pyproject.toml`, `mgit/constants.py`, CLI output

## Scripts and Utilities
- `scripts/copy_linux_binary.py` - Helper for Linux binary distribution after PyInstaller build

## Critical Context for mgit Operations

### Query Pattern System
The query pattern uses `organization/project/repository` format:
- **Azure DevOps**: All three parts are meaningful (org/project/repo)
- **GitHub/BitBucket**: Project part is ignored (org/*/repo works)
- Use wildcards (`*`) in any position for flexible matching
- The `list` command is the primary discovery tool before cloning

### Provider-Specific Authentication Gotchas
1. **Azure DevOps**: 
   - URL must include `https://` prefix
   - PAT needs Code (Read/Write) AND Project (Read) scopes
   - Organization URL format: `https://dev.azure.com/orgname`

2. **GitHub**:
   - Token must be Classic PAT starting with `ghp_`
   - Required scopes: `repo`, `read:org`, `read:user`
   - API endpoint: `https://api.github.com`

3. **BitBucket**:
   - Use App Password, NOT regular password
   - Use username, NOT email address
   - Required permissions: Repositories (Read/Write), Workspaces (Read)

### Monitoring System (Optional Feature)
The monitoring system provides production-grade observability:
- HTTP server with Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`
- Health endpoints: `/health`, `/health/ready`, `/health/live`
- Performance tracking and correlation analysis
- Commands:
  - `mgit monitoring server --port 8080` - Start full monitoring server
  - `mgit monitoring server --simple --port 8080` - Start simple server (no aiohttp dependency)
  - `mgit monitoring health` - Check system health
  - `mgit monitoring health --detailed` - Detailed health check

### Common Workflow Patterns
1. **Discovery First**: Always `list` before `clone-all`
   ```bash
   mgit list "org/*/*" --limit 10  # Discover what's available
   mgit clone-all "org/project/*" ./repos  # Clone specific subset
   ```

2. **Multi-Provider Management**: Use `--config` flag
   ```bash
   mgit list "*/*/*" --config github_work
   mgit list "*/*/*" --config azdo_enterprise
   ```

3. **Bulk Operations**: Use appropriate concurrency
   ```bash
   mgit clone-all "org/*/*" ./repos --concurrency 10  # For many small repos
   mgit clone-all "org/*/*" ./repos --concurrency 2   # For large repos
   ```
