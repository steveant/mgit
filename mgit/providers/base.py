"""Base abstract class for git providers.

This module defines the abstract base class and common data structures
that all git providers must implement. The GitProvider class serves as the
foundation for all provider-specific implementations (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, etc.)

Key Concepts:
- Repository: A git repository hosted on a provider
- Organization: A top-level grouping (GitHub org, Azure DevOps org, etc.)
- Project: An optional intermediate grouping (not all providers support this)
- Authentication: Various methods to authenticate with providers

Usage:
    To implement a new provider, subclass GitProvider and implement all abstract methods.
    See existing providers (github.py, azdevops.py, etc.) for examples.
